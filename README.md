# Account Receivable Signing Demo

In this demo you are signing an invoice of Tessier-Ashpool SA to Weyland-Yutani Corp with your MetaMask account.

The resulting signature can be verified and checked against the Smart Contract in the [invoice-verifier project].

# EIP712 Signing Demo

This is derived from the demonstration of EIP712 signing support (EIP712 Signing Demo) via MetaMask's `eth_signTypedData_v3` API call.

[Try the original version here.](https://weijiekoh.github.io/eip712-signing-demo/index.html)

You need a version of MetaMask that supports eth_signTypedData_v3 to use this demo (4.14+).
